## Working groups

The develop of the Ottawa Data Model mostly occurs with informal working groups are created as needed to improve metadata sections. These working groups are time-limited and follow an agile development approach. Please feel free to suggest of offer hosting a working group in GitHub issues or discussions. 

Working groups propose changes through a pull request to `dev`. Initial review for the PR is from previous contributors. Following there is a pull request from `dev` to `main` for proposed changes to the next version of the Ottawa Data Model. 

We aim for a one-week community review period from `dev` to `main` during the initial agile development period. We welcome community review from anyone in the wastewater surveillance community. The ODM must work for your needed to be successful. Please `watch` this GH repo to ensure you are aware of proposed changed.
