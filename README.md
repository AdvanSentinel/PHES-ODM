# Ottawa Wastewater Surveillance Data Model (Ottawa Data Model (ODM))

This repository contains Ottawa Wastewater Surveillance Data Model (Ottawa Data Model (ODM)). Also included are Ottawa wastewater data - other data are welcomed. Plots using this data can be found at: [613covid.ca](https://613covid.ca/wastewater).

See [Metadata](metadata.md) for variable names and definitions.

## Collaborate

The ODM strives to improve wastewater surveillance through the development of a common data structure, including metadata and vocabulary. Also included are templates (under development) to collect and share data. Templates include versions of Excel spreadsheets from different jurisdictions that are based on the ODM. A SQL database structure is available, as well as code to clean data and create tables.

We adhere to the [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) with recognition of benefit from a common data structure, including metadata and vocabulary.

ODM is a collaborative effort from many people within the wastewater surveillance community in Canada and beyond. See [GH issues](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/covid-19-wastewater/issues) or email [dmanuel\@ohri.ca](mailto:dmanuel@ohri.ca), [howard.swerdfeger\@canada.ca](mailto:howard.swerdfeger@canada.ca).

**v1.0.0 - Many additions and breaking changes. This version is recommended for widespread use.**

- Naming conventions were further developed. Category names shortened to 7 digits to allow wide variable names up to 31 characters.

- Three NEW tables

  - [SiteMeasure](metadata.md#sitemeasure): The site of wastewater sampling, including several defaults that can be used to populate new samples upon creation. SiteMeasure complements the [WWMeasure](metadata.md#wwmeasure) table. It includes measures that are commonly collected by staff at wastewater treatment facilities and field sample locations. Whereas WWMeasure includes measures that are commonly generated by wastewater testing laboratories.
  - [Inststrument](metadata.md#instrument): Instruments that are used for measurements in SiteMeasure and WWMeasure. Note that the assay method itself for viral measurement is described in [AssayMethod](metadata.md#assaymethod).
  - [Lookup](metadata.md#lookup): Reference for categorical variables.

- Names of variables were updated according to the extended naming conventions. Note that these changes are NOT listed here!

- Examples are provided on how to generate wide and long variables and category names.

- Information on how to collaborate is updated.
