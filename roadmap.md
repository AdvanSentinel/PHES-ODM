# Roadmap

The ODM Steering Group or Working Groups have identified the following features and tools for development.

See the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/covid-19-wastewater/projects/3?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen) project for progress on the roadmap. Add new items or discuss on the discussion [thread](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/covid-19-wastewater/discussions/108). Issues with "future" tag are discussed for addition to the roadmap.

## Requirements

Requirements for future tools and features:

- **Support for English and French** - initially for the data model and then other documentation.
- **Open and cross platform** - Tools to support the data model will be generated using or support open software. The objective is to create pseudo-code that can form the basis to program code in R or Python. Rules as pseudo-code allow development teams to generate consistent data applications in other program platforms (i.e. MS 365 or ArcGIS).

## Tools

1. **Data mapping methods** - a collection of methods to:
   Read in data from templates into a database (SQLite supported).
   Conversion from "long" format to "wide" format.
1. **Data cleaning methods** - rules for cleaning raw ODM data. T
1. **Visualization tools** - basic plots to visualize wastewater signals. Simple visualization tools can be part of vignettes to show how to analyze wastewater data.
1. **Transformation functions** - functions to create derived variables and aggreagations. i.e. moving averages.
1. **Open, public data examples within the repository** - Example data to build and test common tools and demonstrate ODM compliant data format.

## Documentation

Documentation that including tutorials, how-to guides, technical references and explanations. See [Divio documentation approach](https://documentation.divio.com).

1. Tutorials - learning-oriented.
1. How-to guides - problem-oriented.
1. Explanation - understanding-oriented.
1. Reference - information-oriented.

- Several presentations have introduced the OMD. Let's make these available.
- Peer-review description with DOI reference.
- Consider a website that organizes document for a wide audience of users.

## Process

- Ensure Steering Committee and Working Groups have representation from a range discplines and regions.
- Add a code of conduct.
